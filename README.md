# Segmentation of Lung in Chest X-ray Dataset
In this project I used [DUCK-Net](https://github.com/RazvanDu/DUCK-Net) model, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) model in segmentation tasks to segment the lungs in [Chest X-ray dataset](https://www.data-in-brief.com/article/S2352-3409(23)00725-4/fulltext). I achieved a Dice score of `%96.4` on the test set.
